    "Baseball isn’t associated with good memories for me. I wasn’t very good at it, always hitting foul balls in little league. My parents eventually figured out I needed glasses, but not before I developed a mild disdain for the sport. So it’s with great surprise that I find myself spending so much time thinking about it. Even more so when I make a bet and start cheering for a team. It’s amazing what having some skin in the game will do for your interest level.\n",
