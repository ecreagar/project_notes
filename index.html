This site houses notes about my various data and analytics side projects. <b>The cool thing about these notes is that they are all executable</b>. Each of the blog posts is a jupyter notebook and has buttons on the top for you to download the code from Github, or run them in the cloud in Binder or Colab. Just click the links and you can edit and run them yourself.

I hope you do. And leave a comment on the page or reach out to me if anything is interesting to you about this work. You can reach me in the links on the footer of this page. That's also where the source code for anything mentioned here can be found.
