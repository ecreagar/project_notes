I'm a semi-retired tech professional, living in Las Vegas, Nevada. I'm forever in school, right now at [University of the People](http://uopeople.edu). I do work to end racial injustices, focusing on criminal justice reform with [Mass Liberation of Nevada](https://www.massliberationnv.org/).

You can get in touch with me using the links at the bottom of this page.
