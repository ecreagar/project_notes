# Las Vegas Municipal Warrant Analysis

I had the opportunity to contribute to a conversation about fines and fees for the upcoming legislative session in Nevada. I took the opportunity to examine the data from the [warrant lookup site for Las Vegas Municipal Court](https://secure3.lasvegasnevada.gov/ewarrantlookup/). What I found was very telling:
 - There are a lot of warrants for this court, enough to arrest one out of every 58 Nevadans. It's incredible to know that we probably have half a dozen other courts in the Las Vegas valley that could be issuing similar levels of warrants.
 - Besides traffic, a lot of warrants are for domestic violence and charges associated with homelessness (trespassing, drug paraphernalia)
 - Speaking of our unhoused population, ~6% of people with warrants had no fixed address. That's 3215 people. In Jan 2019 our state's homeless population was tallied at 7,169. So warrants from this one court cover almost 45% of our state's unhoused population. That kills me. It means an entire population that can be further victimized with impunity because they will be jailed if they try to report a crime.
 - Most of the warrants (~70%) are more than a year old
 - West side (89106) and downtown (89101) have the highest rates of outstanding warrants. They have about 5x the outstanding warrant rate as Summerlin. Race definitely shows up here. Black people are 7-9x as likely to have an outstanding warrant as Whites.
