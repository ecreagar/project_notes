## Nevada Sex Worker Arrest Analysis
I recently had the opportunity to work with a group of sex workers and sex worker advocates. They came together to oppose a proposed bill in the Nevada legislature that is calling for harsher penalties for many types of sex work (AB64). I absolutely support the decriminalization of sex work, and this bill goes the wrong direction.

So I was lucky that they reached out to me to help them understand the data in a public records request that had been filed by dswork.org. I prepared the below dashboard in tableau that helped us come to the following conclusions:
* About 2000 people per year get arrested and charged with prostitution, but less than 40% of them are convicted of that charge. The rest either get reduced charges (16%), or their cases are not pursued by the prosecutors or are dismissed in court (43%). This is clear evidence that the police are arresting large numbers of people without evidence.
* For those charged with Loitering for Purposes of Prostitution, it's even worse. Almost 92% of arrests end with dismissal or denial of charges. Almost no one gets a conviction of this "crime" in Nevada, even though there are more than 200 arrests/year.
* Even though the state of Nevada is only 10.3% Black, 56% of women arrested for prostitution are Black. White women are 74% of Nevadan women and only 39% of arrests for prostitution. Police are clearly targeting Black women.
* 94% of arrests for sex work are done by Las Vegas Metro. Reno and Sparks are <3%. North Las Vegas and Henderson are less than 1% together.
